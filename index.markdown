Hi there!

<img style="float: right" src="assets/profile-picture.jpg" width="260" alt="">

My name is Faizan Ali and I am a Software Engineer with more than 3 years of experience in solving graphics, robotics and optimization problems, a constant learner with curiousity in multiple domains. I never backed down from anything, be it developing architecture of an interactive 3D desktop application, writing localization and control modules for robots or even writing visualization / testing / debugging scripts. Always striving to lead projects towards perfection with continous research and improvement. Philosophy, Graphics, Robotics and Optimization are my topics of interest.

# Work Experience

#### Computational Scientist @ Automotive Artificial Intelligence | Jan 2022 - Mar 2022

- Worked on physically accurate sensor simulation using optix raytracing sdk

<br>

#### Technical Lead (product: Map Editor) @ AutoCanvas.ai (now acquired by AAI gmbh) | Jun 2020 - Dec 2021

- Developed the architecture, features and also lead a team of four people to create Map Editor, which is an interactive 3D desktop application capable of creating, loading and modifying road maps, and also exporting them in industry standard formats (OpenDrive format). Map-Editor is currently providing services to our in-house mapping team, as well as our customer AAI gmbh. This product was added to AAI’s Replicar suite, and was displayed in CES 2022 as well.

#### Lead Perception Engineer @ AutoCanvas.ai | Sep 2019 – May 2020

- Developed ego-car localization modules for Quellen Vergleich project (in collaboration with AAI gmbh), which fused GPS and IMU data along with a non-holonomic motion model. These modules consisted of pre-processing, post-processing and switching observation model nodes for better localization.
- Wrote a scenario visualizer for debugging purposes, which ended up getting used by colleagues at AutoCanvas, as well as for beginning client demos.

#### Perception Engineer | Jan 2019 - Aug 2019

- Wrote scripts for autonomous drone missions (optimal surveillance route, package delivery, autonomous landing on recognized landing marker using mono-camera, aerial imaging).
- Developed simulation environments in Gazebo, Vrep and Unity3D for testing and development of our algorithms.
- Developed custom controllers, which helped us to achieve more precise control over the vehicle.
